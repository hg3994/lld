Singleton -> Limited instances of a class then we use it, ex: Database connection.
Observer -> Real Time updates in the UI.
Factory -> Client will us the instances that we make without exposing the creation logic. All instances are created at one place.
Abstract Factory Pattern -> there is an interface where we make instances of a class. Client can use that interface.
XX Fasade -> Controller where all the business logic will be there.
